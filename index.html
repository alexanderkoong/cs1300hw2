        <p>Dropdown menus are a commonly used user interfaces that conserve screen space by hidng a list of options until activated by the user. They serve as efficient navigation tools and allow users to access multiple options from a single control point without cluttering the interface. When implemented effectively, dropdown menus improve site navigation. This website explores the accessibility of dropdown menus and how we can improve them.</p>

            <tr>
                <td style="border: 1px solid #90cdf4; padding: 10px; vertical-align: top;"><strong>Mouse/Touchpad</strong></td>
                <td style="border: 1px solid #90cdf4; padding: 10px; vertical-align: top;">This particular dropdown menu is relatively easy to navigate. When hovering over the "About" button, the background of the oval surrounding it lights up, highlighting that if clicked, this button will be selected. 

Once clicked, a dropdown menu is released, giving us a menu of options to select. Additionally, the arrow to the right of the text flips from downwards to upwards, further signifying that the menu is being displayed. 

Similar to the "About" button, when the mouse is hovering over a menu option, the background of that particular option is darkened, showing that if clicked that particular option would be selected. 

In the case of the "Explore" menu option, when the mouse is hovering over this option, another submenu pops out to the right, giving way to even more choices.</td>
                <td style="border: 1px solid #90cdf4; padding: 10px; vertical-align: top;">Slack's dropdown menu is very intuitive to navigate. When hovering over the button, the background of the button not only lights up, but the three dots grow bigger (further emphasizing that this button is being selected). Additionally, after a second of hovering, the hidden dropdown menu automatically pops out, bypassing the traditional step of having to click the actual button. This is phenomenal design as it is the perfect balance between convenience (not having to actually click the button if desired), while still having a seamless UI (accidentally scrolling over this button doesn't pop out the menu). 

Once the hidden menu is shown, hovering with the mouse over particular buttons highlights the background. Additionally, once the mouse is moved away from the hidden menu, the hidden menu disappears.</td>
                <td style="border: 1px solid #90cdf4; padding: 10px; vertical-align: top;">The Mail App's dropdown menu has a sleek design that is both intuitive but can be difficult to use. When hovering over the menu button, there is no indication it is being selected beyond the three sub buttons appearing. The lack of the button's background changing colors makes it a little less accessible. 

Once the arrow button is clicked to show the dropdown menu, the arrow changes from pointing to the right to pointing downwards, which clearly shows the user the hidden menu is being displayed. 

Once the hidden menu is displayed, the sub buttons additionally lack the same "hover to highlight" user experience that clearly shows which button is being displayed. It is only when a button is selected that the button's background is highlighted.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td style="border: 1px solid #90cdf4; padding: 10px; vertical-align: top;"><strong>Keyboard</strong></td>
                <td style="border: 1px solid #90cdf4; padding: 10px; vertical-align: top;">When using the keyboard to navigate, the tab button is used to navigate between main buttons (ex: "Ride", "Drive", "Business", etc.). Once on the desired button, the enter key mimics what clicking on a button does, dropping down the hidden menu. From there, the arrow keys are used to navigate the submenu (ex: between "About us", "Our offerings", etc.), and the return key is used to select a part of the submit. 

It is worth noting that when the submenu is dropped down, a blue box appears around the submenu, showing that it has been selected and the arrow keys will navigate this particular menu. 

To leave this submenu and return to the main page to navigate to other areas of the website, the user can simply press the escape key and continue pressing the tab key to move to the next button (and shift+tab to return to the previous button).</td>
                <td style="border: 1px solid #90cdf4; padding: 10px; vertical-align: top;">When using the keyboard to navigate, the arrow keys are used to move between buttons on the left side. Once a particular button is selected, a white box is created around the button that is highlighted. From there, the return key is used to select something. This is similar to clicking the touchpad. 

Slack also has a unique feature that allows you to switch between workspaces using keyboard shortcuts. To move from workspace to workspace, the user can simply press the "command" key and then a particular number, which allows for seamless navigation.</td>
                <td style="border: 1px solid #90cdf4; padding: 10px; vertical-align: top;">Using the keyboard to navigate the mail app is very difficult and not very intuitive. After playing around with various keys for 15 minutes, I was still unable to successfully open the hidden drop down menu. 

Like most apps, the up and down arrow keys are used to navigate between apps (vertically), while the tab key interestingly is used for horizontal navigation between buttons. 

This design is not particularly intuitive as it doesn't allow for clear navigation between the smaller buttons (ex: opening a submenu).</td>

                <td style="border: 1px solid #90cdf4; padding: 10px; vertical-align: top;"></td>
                <td style="border: 1px solid #90cdf4; padding: 10px; vertical-align: top;">From a touch perspective, the mail app is very intuitive to use, likely because it was designed with the intention of being able to use it on a smartphone or iPad. Similar to using a mouse/trackpad, clicking the arrow opens a submenu, which allows for additional buttons to be clicked. It is worth noting that the background of these buttons only change color when physically selected. However, the panel slides to the left when selecting, hiding the menu itself.</td>

                        <li>This diagram is specifically made for a submenu with three options (the three purple options). Each of the three interactions in purple are essentially duplicates and can be scaled to as many menu options out there.</li>
                        <li>Additionally, my redesign incorporates a new feature that when the mouse is hovering over a submenu selection item, the background of the submenu option is changed to a lighter color. This allows the user to better understand what submenu option is being selected.</li>
                        <li>This affects accessibility in people with visual impairments and cognitive disabilities, as they will be able to better understand what submenu option is being selected. This would be less efficient for mouse users as quickly scrolling through all menu options could be confusing/rapidly highlight a variety of boxes, but would be much easier to navigate for slow moving users who have disabilities.</li>

        <ul>
            <li>The components I observed (primary Uber and Slack) did well in terms of keyboard accessibility, allowing for users to easily navigate using both the arrow keys and the tab/return key. The Mail App was not as strong in this regard as the keyboard navigation was far less intuitive.</li>
            
            <li>Standard dropdowns also usually have a consistent visual structure that helps users with cognitive disabilities. This is usually enhanced by high contrast in color/font sizing, as well as small, succinct blocks of highly descriptive text.</li>
            
            <li>Many dropdown implementations fail to provide proper announcements/visuals for state changes. For example, the default Mail app on the Apple IOS operating system lacks any sort of distinction when the mouse is hovering over a submenu option. This can lead to difficulty in understanding what will occur when the trackpad is clicked.</li>
            
            <li>I accounted for this in my updated design by ensuring that when the mouse is hovering over a button, the background of the button changes color, ensuring that the user understands this button is being selected.</li>
            
            <li>As per the video's definition of mismatched experiences, the change I made solved a mismatch for people who have visual impairments and have difficulty navigating computers with just the cursor. Previously, navigating a dropdown menu may have been difficult as it was unclear which button would be "selected" when the mouse was hovering over it now; now, because the background of these buttons change color, people with eyesight issues and other visual impairments will be able to determine which submenu item is being selected.</li>
            
            <li>Based on Parts 1 and 2, the ability to navigate through dropdown menus with just the keyboard could positively impact users with fine motor impairments who are unable to use a mouse.</li>
            
            <li>Conversely, users with visual and cognitive impairments who are unable to see or immediately comprehend what they are seeing are negatively impacted by the lack of clear visual feedback when hovering over a submenu option in the Mail App.</li>
            
            <li>Mouse users are most commonly prioritized, given this is the most popular and common way to navigate components. This impacts user experience because those who have mismatched experiences and are unable to use a mouse must rely on secondary, alternative navigation techniques that are often neglected, underdeveloped, and hard to use.</li>
